# STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE CODES FOR THE LAUNCH AND MOTION BUTTONS VIA TRIAL AND ERROR.
# Basically used the Curtis Electronics TV remote as a starting point, since that's cira 1996 and relatively primitive
# (no headers or anything). Then stripped that down from 13 bits to 4 bits. Not sure how to vary the duty cycle of
# ones and zeros yet, looks like that's a global setting for ALL the buttons.  Grr.
